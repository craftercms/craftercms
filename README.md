# 3. Build Deployable Binaries

To build deployable and distributable binaries of CrafterCMS, use the Gradle task `bundle`. This task will generate `.tar.gz` files ready to be deployed to any system.

Before using `bundle` task make sure that the environment has been created and deployed using gradle tasks `build` and `deploy`

Archives will be named `crafter-cms-${environment}-VERSION.tar.gz` and can be found in the `bundles` folder.

```bash
./gradlew build deploy bundle
```

To run CrafterCMS from the binary archive, unzip and follow the instructions in the binary archive's `README.txt`.

## 3.1. Build Environment Specific Binaries
CrafterCMS is a decoupled CMS, and that means you have an `authoring` environment that caters to content creators, and a different environment, `delivery`, that handles the end-users that use the experience created by the former.

To build a binary archive for a specific environment:

```bash
    ./gradlew bundle -Penv=authoring
```
Archive will be named `crafter-cms-authoring-${version}.tar.gz` and can be found in the `bundles` folder.

For the `delivery` environment, simply substitute the `env=authoring` with `env=delivery`.

## 3.2 Update, Build and Bundle from a Tag/Branch

To download, build and generate a binary archive from a given tag or branch of the source code,

1. Clone the branch/tag of craftercms that you want to work with
```bash
    git clone -b <tag or branch> https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/
```
2. Download, build and bundle the tag/branch that you want to work with
```bash
    ./gradlew build deploy bundle
```

> **_NOTE:_**
When using a tag-based build, you're essentially cloning a point in time to build that specific version of CrafterCMS. That implies that you won't be able to update/nor push changes back.

# 4. Build a Developer's Environment
CrafterCMS comprises a number of headless API-first (GraphQL, REST, in-process)  modules that work together to provide the final solution. In this section, we'll start with the simple case of _build everything_/_run everything_, and then move on to building/hacking individual modules.


## 4.1. Build, Start and Stop All
### 4.1.1. Build All
Build all CrafterCMS modules

```bash
    ./gradlew build deploy
```

### 4.1.2. Start All
Start CrafterCMS,

 ```bash
    ./gradlew start
```

You can now point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/studio](http://localhost:8080/studio) and start using CrafterCMS. To get started with your first CrafterCMS experience, you can follow this guide: [Your First Templated Project](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.1/getting-started/your-first-project/templated.html) or [Your First Headless Project](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.1/getting-started/your-first-project/headless.html).

> **_NOTE:_**
    * The authoring environment runs on port `8080`, a great place to start, while the delivery environment runs on port `9080`.

### 4.1.3. Stop All
Stop CrafterCMS,

```bash
    ./gradlew stop
```

### 4.2. Two Environments: Authoring vs Delivery
You might have noticed that you essentially have two environments built and running: `authoring` and `delivery`. CrafterCMS is a decoupled CMS, and that means you have an `authoring` environment that caters to content creators, and a different environment, `delivery`, that handles the end-users that use the experience created by the former.

As a developer, you can use an `authoring` environment for most tasks without the need to run a `delivery` environment. It's important to note that `delivery` essentially runs the same software that's in `authoring` except Crafter Studio (the authoring tools).
By default, this project will build both environments unless instructed otherwise. The `authoring` environment runs at [http://localhost:8080/studio](http://localhost:8080/studio), whereas the `delivery` environment runs at [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080/).

### 4.2.1. Build, Start, and Stop a Specific Environment
To build, start and stop one of the two environments is similar to building/starting/stopping All.

#### Authoring
```bash
    ./gradlew build deploy -Penv=authoring
    ./gradlew start -Penv=authoring
    ./gradlew stop -Penv=authoring
```

#### Delivery
```bash
    ./gradlew build deploy -Penv=delivery
    ./gradlew start -Penv=delivery
    ./gradlew stop -Penv=delivery
```

### 4.3. Crafter Modules
The mechanics for working with a single module are similar to working with _all_, with one exception: You can deploy a module to one or both environments (`authoring`/`delivery`).

CrafterCMS comprises the following modules:
* [`engine`](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.1/reference/modules/engine/index.html)
* [`studio`](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.1/reference/modules/studio/index.html)
* [`profile`](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.1/reference/modules/profile/index.html)
* [`social`](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.1/reference/modules/social/index.html)
* [`deployer`](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.1/reference/modules/deployer/index.html)

You'll find these projects checked out and ready for you to contribute to in the folder `src/{modules}`.

### 4.3.1. Forking a Module
Start by forking the module you want to work on. You can follow the [GitHub instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
The next step is to switch the origin url location to be the one just forked, to do so you can use [these GitHub instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/).
The last step will be to add an upstream repository from the main `craftercms` repo to your own. Follow [these steps](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-3-configure-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-spoon-knife-repository)
to make it happen.
You can now work in your local system, and build/deploy and ultimately push to your fork. We welcome code contributions, so please do send us pull-requests.

To update your project with the latest:

```bash
    ./gradlew update
```

### 4.3.2. Update, Build, Deploy, Start, and Stop a Module
You can update, build, deploy, start or stop a module by:

```bash
    ./gradlew update -Pmodules=studio
    ./gradlew build -Pmodules=studio
    ./gradlew deploy -Pmodules=studio -Penv=authoring
    ./gradlew start -Pmodules=studio -Penv=authoring
    ./gradlew stop -Pmodules=studio -Penv=authoring
```

> **_NOTE:_**
    * If you don't specify the `env` parameter, it means all environments (where applicable).
    * In the current version of CrafterCMS, some services run in the same Web container, and that implies the stopping/starting of one of these services will cause other services to stop/start as well.

# 5. Advanced Topics
For more detailed information and advanced topic, please visit the [detailed documentation](https://docs.craftercms.org/en/4.1/by-role/developer/index.html).

CrafterCMS has two environments, the Authoring Environment and the Delivery Environment.

The authoring environment provides all the content management services, enabling authoring, managing and publishing of all content.  It provides a comprehensive set of user-friendly features for managing and optimizing your experiences.

The delivery environment provides content delivery services.  It consumes content published from your authoring environment and provides developers with the foundation for quickly building high-performance, flexible experiences.

In this section we will be discussing the scripts for the authoring and delivery environments.

## 5.1 Authoring and Delivery Environment Scripts

The CrafterCMS Authoring and Delivery scripts will help you on the basic startup and shutdown of the services needed to run a healthy *Authoring environment* and *Delivery environment* with the following scripts:

| **Script**|``crafter.sh``|

<br><br>
Let's look at an example on how to start an authoring environment using the scripts we discussed above.  To start the authoring environment, go to your CrafterCMS install folder then run the following:

```bash
   cd crafter-authoring
   ./startup.sh
```

What the above does is go to your authoring environment folder, then run the startup script.

To stop the authoring environment:

```bash
   ./shutdown.sh
```

### 5.1.1 Other Scripts

For more information about Apache Tomcat, and OpenSearch please refer to the following:

 * [Tomcat Script documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/RUNNING.txt)
 * [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/)


## 5.2 Gradle Authoring and Delivery Environment Scripts

As we have seen in the getting started section above, to run a gradle task, we run the following from the root of the project:

```bash
   ./gradlew command [-Penv={env}] [-Pmodules={module}]
```


Here's a list of commands (Gradle tasks) available:

| Command<br>``command`` | Description | Env Options<br>``env`` | Module Options<br>``module`` |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| clone | Clones CrafterCMS | <ul><li>None</li></ul> | <ul><li>None</li></ul> |

| clean | Delete all compiled objects | <ul><li>None</li></ul> | <ul><li>None</li></ul> |

> **_NOTE:_**
    * If you don't specify the ``env`` parameter, it means all environments (where applicable).
    * In the current version of CrafterCMS, some services run in the same Web container, and that implies the stopping/starting of one of these services will cause other services to stop/start as well.
    * The Gradle task property ``modules`` accepts one or multiple module/s, separated by commas like this: ``./gradlew build -Pmodules=search,studio``
    * The ``clean`` command does not delete previously built environment folders ``crafter-authoring`` and ``crafter-delivery``. To build a fresh copy of these two, backup your custom data and delete both folders manually.

<br><br>
Let's see some examples of running Gradle tasks here.

### 5.2.1 BUILD

To build the authoring and delivery environments, run the following:

```bash
   ./gradlew build
```

The Gradle task above will:

1. Download the dependencies
2. Build all CrafterCMS modules from the source (check the [section](#git) on how to update the source)

    - ``crafter-authoring``
    - ``crafter-delivery``

To build a module (all module options for task ``build`` are listed in the table above), run the following (we'll build the module *studio* in the example below):

```bash
   ./gradlew build -Pmodules=studio
```

To build an environment, run the following (we'll build the authoring environment in the example below:

```bash
   ./gradlew build -Penv=authoring
```

### 5.2.2 START

To start an environment, run the following:

```bash
   ./gradlew start [-Penv={env}]
```

For an alternative to start an environment, run the following:

```bash
   cd crafter-{env}
   ./startup.sh
```

The options above will:

For the *Authoring Environment*:

* The above will start the authoring environment with the default port 8080

For the *Delivery Environment*:

* The above will start the delivery environment with the default port 9080

Here's an example starting a delivery environment:

```bash
   ./gradlew start -Penv=delivery
```

### 5.2.3 STOP

To stop an environment, run the following:

```bash
   ./gradlew stop [-Penv={env}]
```

For an alternative to stop an environment, run the following:

```bash
   cd crafter-{env}
   ./shutdown.sh
```

### 5.2.4 BUNDLE

The Gradle task ``bundle`` will build deployable and distributable binaries of CrafterCMS for the authoring and/or delivery environments.  This will generate tar files ready to be unarchived and run.

```bash
   ./gradlew bundle [-Penv={env}]
```

Binaries will be saved as ``crafter-cms-authoring-VERSION.tar.gz`` for the *Authoring Environment* and ``crafter-cms-delivery-VERSION.tar.gz`` for the *Delivery Environment* in the ``bundles`` folder

Using the common task property ``env`` lets you select what environment (authoring or delivery) will be generated.

Let's look at an example using the task property mentioned above:

```bash
    ./gradlew bundle -Penv=authoring
```

The command above will generate an authoring binary archive in the bundles folder named ``crafter-cms-authoring-VERSION.tar.gz``.
