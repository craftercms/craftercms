     This file configures the proxy servers for preview.

     Every request received by Engine will be matched against the patterns of each server
     and the first one that matches will be used as proxy.

     <server>
         <id/> (id of the server, can have any value)
         <url/> (url of the server, if missing or empty the request will be executed locally)
         <patterns>
             <pattern/> (regex to match requests)
         </patterns>
