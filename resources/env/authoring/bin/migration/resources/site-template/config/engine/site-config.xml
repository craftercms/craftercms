        Disables full content model type conversion.

        Up to and including version 2:
        Crafter Engine, in the FreeMarker host only, converts model elements based on a suffix type hint, but only for the first level in
        the model, and not for _dt. For example, for contentModel.myvalue_i Integer is returned, but for contentModel.repeater.myvalue_i
        and contentModel.date_dt a String is returned. In the Groovy host no type of conversion was performed.

        In version 3 onwards, Crafter Engine converts elements with any suffix type hints (including _dt) at at any level in the content
        model and for both Freemarker and Groovy hosts.
