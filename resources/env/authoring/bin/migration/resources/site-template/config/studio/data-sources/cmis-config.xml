    CMIS repositories configuration file. This files configures 0 or more
    CMIS-capable repositories as data-sources for content authors to pick
    from.

Items can be selected in one of two modes:
- Reference: the item selected is referenced via URL and Crafter CMS will
    simply insert a direct link to the CMIS repository so the end-user
    will pull the content directly from the CMIS repo
- Clone: the item selected is downloaded into Crafter CMS and the end-user
    will pull the content from Crafter CMS

For every repository you need to specify:
    <cmis>
        <repositories>
            <repository>
                <id />
                <type />
                <url />
                <username />
                <password />
                <base-path />
                <download-url-regex />
            </repository>
        </repositories>
    </cmis>

    id:	a unique id for this repository, this will be referenced in the
        data source defined in the content type
    type: type of the repository, currently Alfresco is the only supported
        type
    url: url to the CMIS repository
    username: username to use to browse the CMIS repository. You only need
        read access
    password: password to use for the username above
    base-path: the base-path to limit browsing under (this means authors
        using this repository will be limited to browsing under this path)
    download-url-regex: a regular expression that includes the variable
        {item_id}. The regular expression contains the full download URL
        pattern to the item in the CMIS repository, and {item_id} will be
        replaced by Crafter CMS with the selected item ID.
